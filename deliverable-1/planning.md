## Product Details
 
#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

 We are planning to build a web application that will help the cancer survivors/patients to connect with each other based on the data they provide. 
 
 Cancer doesn’t only affect someone's physical health but also takes a toll on their mental stability. This life-changing diagnosis and the exhausting treatment that comes after   it can induce feelings like anxiety, distress, depression, and **loneliness**. 
 
### And WE BELIEVE 

## NO ONE SHOULD FACE CANCER ALONE

Therefore, to solve this problem we are making an app that will help the patients find a partner to date or a mentor to consult. (Maybe Both!!) 

Our goal is to improve their mental health through which we can improve their treatment, physical health, and the life ahead. 

We have designed a [mockup](https://www.figma.com/proto/AKsBmCRIOOWOj00waI7xUa/Untitled?node-id=18%3A12&scaling=contain)
#### Q2: Who are your target users?

  > Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. a 'a third-year university student studying Computer Science' and not 'a student')
 * **Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.         
   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).**

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

> Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
    * Does this application exist in another form? If so, how does your differ and provide value to the users?
    * How does this align with your partner's organization's values/mission/mandate?

#### Q4: How will you build it?

> Short (1-2 min' read max)
 * What is the technology stack? Specify any and all languages, frameworks, libraries, PaaS products or tools. 
 * How will you deploy the application?
 * Describe the architecture - what are the high level components or patterns you will use? Diagrams are useful here. 
 * Will you be using third party applications or APIs? If so, what are they?
 * What is your testing strategy?

#### Q5: What are the user stories that make up the MVP?

 * At least 5 user stories concerning the main features of the application - note that this can broken down further
 * You must follow proper user story format (as taught in lecture) ```As a <user of the app>, I want to <do something in the app> in order to <accomplish some goal>```
 * If you have a partner, these must be reviewed and accepted by them
 * The user stories should be written in Github and each one must have clear acceptance criteria.

## Process Details

#### Q6: What are the roles & responsibilities on the team?

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role. 
 * Roles should reflect the structure of your team and be appropriate for your project. Not necessarily one role to one team member.

List each team member and:
 * A description of their role(s) and responsibilities including the components they'll work on and non-software related work
 * 3 technical strengths and weaknesses each (e.g. languages, frameworks, libraries, development methodologies, etc.)

#### Q7: What operational events will you have as a team?

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have. 
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc.
 * You must have at least 2 meetings with your project partner (if you have one) before D1 is due. Describe them here:
   * What did you discuss during the meetings?
   * What were the outcomes of each meeting?
   * You must provide meeting minutes.
   * You must have a regular meeting schedule established by the second meeting.  
  
#### Q8: What artifacts will you use to self-organize?

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), meeting minutes, etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?
   * How do you determine the status of work from inception to completion?

#### Q9: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

Describe your team's working culture.

**Communications:**
 * What is the expected frequency? What methods/channels are appropriate? 
 * If you have a partner project, what is your process (in detail) for communicating with your partner?
 
**Meetings:**
 * How are people held accountable for attending meetings, completing action items? Is there a moderator or process?
 
**Conflict Resolution:**
 * List at least three team scenarios/conflicts you discussed in lecture and how you decided you will resolve them. Indecisions? Non-responsive team members? Any other scenarios you can think of?

### Highlights

Specify 3 - 5 key decisions and/or insights that came up during your meetings
and/or collaborative process.

 * Short (5 min' read max)
 * Decisions can be related to the product and/or the team process.
    * Mention which alternatives you were considering.
    * Present the arguments for each alternative.
    * Explain why the option you decided on makes the most sense for your team/product/users.
 * Essentially, we want to understand how (and why) you ended up with your current product and process plan.
 * This section is useful for important information regarding your decision making process that may not necessarily fit in other sections. 
 
*Choosing Projects*: From the start of the project our approach to every decision so far has been to take a vote. For the project selection, we decided to give each team member the chance to vote for as many projects as they wanted but each vote of theirs had varying weights. Each team member was allowed to assign values of 1, 0.75, 0.5 and 0.25 only once to each respective project of their choosing, and 0.1 zero or more times to projects without a vote. The top three projects which had the highest weight aggregate were chosen to include in the proposal. We used this method because it gave each team member time to decide on their own without being swayed by the opinion of other group members, and this made for a better way to gauge everyone’s interests. The projects with the top 3 scores were chosen to be included in our project proposal. 

*Meeting Times*: Instead of picking meeting times and having team members make adjustments to their schedule  accordingly we decided to take everyone’s timetables (including lecture times and other commitments) and time zones into account and found common free times where the meetings would take place. This way no one would have to adjust their schedules to fit team meetings, we found this to be a good way of coordinating this as it took every input into account. 

*Web or Mobile*: After the first team meeting with the partner it was decided that we would be developing a web app instead of a mobile app. The main reason for this was that the partner already has a user base from cancermatch.com and would like to migrate them over to our web app. Going with a mobile app would have been another hurdle in this process as we would have had to account for different platforms and would add another step for the users as they would have to download the app.

*Type of Database*: We chose to use a SQL database for this project. Initially we wanted to work with a NoSQL database as it would have been easier to use and implement for us but after meetings with the partner and a team meeting we decided to go with a SQL database as the product we are building is meant to be used for an extended period of time. This meant that using a NoSQL database like MongoDB might have caused problems for the client in the long run and for that reason we decided not to use it. 

*Front end Framework*: For this we chose to use React. An alternative to this would have been Vue JS, we decided against using Vue JS as most of us don’t have experience working with it. Another reason for choosing React was its huge community which is exemplified with many more tutorials and StackOverflow questions, both of which might come to be very useful to us. React is also maintained by Facebook which means that there is long term support available whereas Vue is maintained by a team financed by crowdfunding.
