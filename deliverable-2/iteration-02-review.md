## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

 1. Having separate chats for frontend and backend

Our team had decided to use Messenger as our communication platform since all of us check it regularly. During the early stages of development, we only had one group chat “CSC301 4.0 Gang”. Discussing all the different features and details of the web application was getting too clustered between the six of us; we found often discussions only involved part of the overall team, and sometimes multiple issues were being discussed at the same time. Therefore, we decided to separate out the work between three different chats:
* The main group “CSC301 4.0 Gang”
* A group for our backend team “CSC301 4.0 BackEnd Gang”
* A group for our frontend team “CSC301 4.0 Frontend Gang”

This decision turned out well because it helped us save a lot of time and made many complex discussions easier. We were then able to communicate more efficiently.

2. Making a Taskboard

After assigning different tasks to different members, we were pretty sure that we would complete every task smoothly, but that wasn’t the case. When we actually started working on different features, we realised that there were many tasks that were dependent on each other, that is, some tasks needed to be finished before starting the next one. This halted the progress for many members multiple times.

To overcome this problem we decide that we should make separate task boards for the frontend and backend team, and work in unison on sorting that task board. Using these task boards gave us a clear idea of our progress in relation to other members, and helped us to prioritize our tasks accordingly.

3. Always working in Pairs

The other decision that turned out to be well was working in pairs whenever possible. We decided that at a time whenever we are working on a feature at least two members would be online for making decisions and writing code. The division of different pairs and the times that we would work in was decided separately for frontend and backend tasks. Amongst the different pairs, our working methods sometimes included pair programming on a video call or just staying online for discussing things in a continuous flow. 

This decision helped us save some time in decision making and we were able to write code with minimal errors. It not only helped the members to get familiar with each other but also helped understand each other’s code better.

4. Separating out the branches for the frontend team and the backend team

In all our previous group coding assignments, the one thing that all of us never liked  were the merge conflicts. Therefore, before starting the work for this project, our team decided to have separate branches for the frontend and the backend. In the picture above the black branch is master (with least frequent and most important commits), the blue branch is frontend-develop (the branch for frontend team), the green branch is frontend-connect (the branch for the backend team). In addition to these branches, whenever it was possible we chose to work on a new branch (purple branches) for a new feature which made the workflow as smooth as possible. 

This decision turned out well because it gave us fewer merge conflicts and allowed us to work efficiently without breaking each other’s code. In the end, we think it helped us save a lot of time.





#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1. Meeting every week

When we got paired with our partner, we were all excited to work on this project for both personal and professional reasons. We knew that communication is important for this project to be successful, but as the time passed we faced multiple challenges as a group and in our individual lives as well. Our decision of meeting every week on a zoom call did not turn out as well as we hoped because university life made it near impossible.

Almost everyone in our team was taking 6 courses, which made it difficult to allocate time every week for a single course. On top of that, mid-semester, one of our members got Covid. But at the end, we believe this course helped us improve our time management skills. 
 
2. Having no Hierarchy 

When we started the project we thought that it would be better for us to work together, instead of maintaining a hierarchical structure within our group. We decided that there should be no single person assuming the position of a manager/leader/spokesperson, instead we should all just directly communicate with each other all the time. 

![Team No Hierarchy Diagram](../images/nohr.png)

(imagine that each circle represents a member and wires represent communication links)
This decision turned out to be way worse than expected because no one was able to keep up with all the details of the project and we faced multiple instances where we missed out on some major details/features. This led to confusion amongst the members and wasted a lot of time and effort.

3. Splitting the team into two equal halves

One of the other naive decisions that we made during Deliverable 1 was to split the team into two halves, backend and frontend, with three members per team. This decision seemed to be quite fair when we started working but as the project progressed we realised that the backend tasks were comparatively heavy and required more support. For our website, the backend development involved things like making a matching algorithm and an in-app chatting feature on top of the other APIs used for authentication and storing user data. By the time we realised our mistake, we had already wasted a lot of time. When we tried to shift one member from the frontend to backend, it took extra time for that member to get familiar with backend code. Therefore, the decision to split the team into two equal halves was not a good idea.

4. Not using Github issues

After Deliverable 1, we decided not to use Github issues for keeping track of our tasks as we thought it would be time consuming. This decision did not turn out well because towards the end of the project we realised that we are missing some major details in our code which happened due to lack of communication, as everyone was not on the same page. 

If we had used Github Issues to keep track of the tasks, enhancements, and bugs for the project, all of us would have known about each other’s progress. Github Issues are sort of a bug tracker on Github and they can be shared and discussed with the rest of the team easily. Not using Github Issues to manage ourselves made the project more complex as we progressed because everyone was not on the same page.



 


#### Q3. Planned changes

 1. Two members looking over backend and frontend
 
As mentioned before, we were facing multiple problems due to the lack of structure within our group. To solve this problem, we came to a conclusion that we should have two members looking over the backend and frontend, one for the backend and one for the frontend. These two members would head the backend and frontend teams respectively, and keep the other members within their own teams posted about any details that are essential to maintain a fluid workflow.

These two members are also responsible for communicating with each other and share details that are required to integrate the backend and the frontend efficiently. We planned this change to improve our speed and save time.

2. Instead of abandoning regular meetings, leaving comments on Google docs and our taskboards

Meeting every week was near impossible for our group. Everyone had their individual academic busyness and life problems to deal with that we didn’t take into account, but we also realised that exchange of information still needs to be better. But instead of having a total lack of communication, we are planning to leave more comments and updates on our individual work in our team group chat, in the code, the shared Google docs, and the taskboards. We decided to make our comments as detailed as possible so that when another person starts working on a task related to yours, they can easily analyze where you left off and continue working from there.

3. Allocating more time to Retrospect 

Another change that we want to include is allocating more time to retrospect about teams progress and problems. We will talk about challenges that halted our progress and how we can make the process more smooth.
We will ask these three questions:
* What went well - We will discuss the progress we have made and some key decisions that helped us complete certain tasks.
* What could have been improved - We will discuss the tasks and approaches that were raising a lot of errors.
* Actions to be taken - After talking about both of the above mentioned things, we are going to brainstorm how we can do things even better.







## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 
 For our demo, we created a small powerpoint presentation which helped us explain our progress, our decisions, and our product. Along with a presentation, we used zoom meetings to practice our demonstration, in which one person would share his screen and explain the features of the app on their local system.

 
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 
 Our product is a dating/mentorship social networking website. We managed to demo the login and registration page, the chatting feature, and the matching algorithm that we created. 

 
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 
 Our partner was happy with features that we presented. He was impressed with the chatting feature and the fact that we included all the right questions that he asked for on the registration page.
 
 
 * Were there change requests?
 
 Although the partner was happy with the features, he wanted us to improve the aesthetics of the website a bit. He also requested a separate admin page for the website that would give him the emails of users satisfying certain criteria, to help him send personalised information about the new treatments in the market for his users.
 
 
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 
 The key fact that we learned from the demo is that if we didn’t have this iteration in our product development then we might not have met the clients' needs to our best level. This demo served as a progress check with our partner and helped us to retrospect and change our methods of working. It is better to have iterations/demos like this so that we can improve efficiently to make the best product that meets our clients needs.
